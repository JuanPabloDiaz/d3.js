# D3.js

Building my own D3.js playground

## About

This is a simple Next.js app that uses D3.js to render multiple components.

_I am not using images, but rather **Scalable Vector Graphics** (SVGs) to render the components. It is a powerful way to render graphics by using DATA to create and manipulate SVGs._

The app is a work in progress and is intended to be a learning experience for me.

That being said, I will be developing and testing new component ideas and features as I learn more about D3.js.

Currently, I am working on multiple components. The components will include a world map, a country chart, a word cloud and much more.

To learn more about D3.js, please visit the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) website.
